Some TODOs to make the plots better.

1. Make every plot prettier (now they are very basic), e.g., styles (ggplot, etc), fonts, titles and legend positions, etc. 
2. ~~For bar plots, add error bars.~~ -> DONE
3. For latency over steps plot, potentially using a range, covering the standard deviation (fill_between). -> ScatterPlot with density implemented -> STILL OPEN
4. For the accelerator ratio figure, add some arrows with explanation, e.g., when EncDec-S retrieval interval = 1, say multiple FPGAs are needed; for large interval, say multiple GPUs are needed
